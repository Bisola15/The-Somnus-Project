# The-Somnus-Project

# Vision Statement
We are working with scientists and researchers to teach and create awareness about the effect of sleep deprivation on mental health, so as to reduce the incidence of sleep-related mental disturbances.

We aim to provide adequate information to some significantly sleep-deprived focus groups—nigerian school students and techies—and eventually spread this mission internationally.

The goal is to piggyback on already-existing research works, and additionally carry out surveys involving the aforementioned focus groups. The data collated will hopefully help encourage better sleep patterns, prevent unnoticed mental disturbances (irritability, impaired judgment) and more significant ones (hallucination, dementia).
