# The-Somnus-Project

# Vision Statement
We are working with scientists and researchers to teach and create awareness about the effect of sleep deprivation on mental health, so as to reduce the incidence of sleep-related mental disturbances.

We aim to provide adequate information to some significantly sleep-deprived focus groups—nigerian university students—and eventually spread this mission internationally.

The goal is to piggyback on already-existing research works, and additionally carry out surveys involving the aforementioned focus groups. The data collated will hopefully help encourage better sleep patterns, prevent unnoticed mental disturbances (irritability, impaired judgment) and more significant ones (hallucination, dementia).

# Roadmap

## OBJECTIVE
To study the sleep patterns of Nigerian university students, and how they impact their mental health?

## LITERATURE REVIEW
To examine the current state of knowledge on sleep patterns and mental health, and identify gaps in knowledge, we will conduct a comprehensive literature review studying journals and articles on sleep patterns and effects extensively and narrowing it down to available studies on the subject matter in Nigeria, specifically.

### This Project will have 5 main steps which has been highlighted below.

## RESEARCH DESIGN
 * Research method
     * Data will be collected using surveys

* Sample size and selection method
    * Sample size to be collated will be a minimum of 100-200people across Nigeria’s six geopolitical zones.

 * Develop the survey questionnaire 
    * This will include questions about sleep patterns, mental health, and related factors such as stress, diet, exercise.

* Distribution of questionnaires and data collection
    * For ease in data collection, the survey will be built with Google Forms, and responses will automatically be entered into a Google Sheet. Links to this form will only be shared to selected participants.

## DATA ANALYSIS
* Yet to decide.

* Interpretation of the results in order to draw conclusions about the sleep patterns of Nigerian university students.

## COLLABORATION
* Communicate findings to experts in the field of sleep, neuroscience, Mental Health, and Education. They will contribute their expertise and knowledge to the project.

* Collaborate with other writers
    * Reach out to writers who will edit, proofread and co-author the articles for journal publication.


## PUBLICATION
* Write up the findings and conclusions in a clear, concise and easy-to-digest manner.
* Find and select possible journals for peer review
* Submit the article for peer review.
* If accepted, work with editors to finalise the article for publication.

## PROMOTION
* Share the published articles with Nigerian universities, local papers, policy makers and stakeholders.

* Disseminate the findings through social media, conferences, or workshops.
